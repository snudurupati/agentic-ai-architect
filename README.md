# The Agentic AI Architect: 8-Week Curriculum

**From Data Engineer to AI Systems Architect.**

This repository hosts the code and curriculum for the 8-week "Agentic AI Architect" roadmap. Each folder corresponds to a week of study, moving from LLM fundamentals to building a production-ready **Data Contract Validator** agent.

## 📂 Curriculum Structure

| Week | Topic | Key Concepts |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **[Week 0](./00_agentic_data_engineer)** | **The Agentic Data Engineer** | *The original demo. How to start thinking like an agent.* |
| **[Week 1](./01_stochastic_cpu)** | **The Stochastic CPU** | Latency, tokens, and the "new compute" mindset. |
| **Week 2** | **Structured Output** | Making LLMs deterministic with Pydantic. |
| **Week 3** | **RAG Fundamentals** | Vector databases, embeddings, and semantic search. |
| **Week 4** | **Advanced RAG** | Hybrid search, re-ranking, and overcoming retrieval failures. |
| **Week 5** | **Agent Orchestration** | Moving from chains to state machines (LangGraph). |
| **Week 6** | **Tools & MCP** | Giving agents "hands" (SQL, APIs) and the Model Context Protocol. |
| **Week 7** | **Evals & Observability** | Testing the untestable: LLM-as-a-judge and tracing. |
| **Week 8** | **Security & Guardrails** | Preventing prompt injection and PII leakage. |
| **Capstone**| **Data Contract Validator** | A production agent that documents and validates schemas. |
